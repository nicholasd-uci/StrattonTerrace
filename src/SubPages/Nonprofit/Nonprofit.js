        501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations can now maximize their AdWords results for free! Our experienced team has gone through this process many times and understand what it takes to get approval, 
        achieve success with Google Grantees, as well as help qualified 501 (that's you!) apply. Did yaâ€™ll know that your non profit qualifies at $10k per month? 
        That means if they sign up today under "FREE" then tomorrow morning when we log back into our account there will be no strings attached 
        other than those pesky levels of compliance - See how easy THAT was?! </p>
