          Search Engine Optimization is the process of getting your website ranked in the top when being searched. SEO can be done by utilizing tools like Google Ad-words, 
          Bing Ads, or social media! This can help generate organic traffic - this means when someone clicks using your key words it will relate it to your page.
          Implementing these types of program would likely increase sales for an e-commerce store since more customers will find what they're looking for through search engines 
          rather than browsing around aimlessly with no intention.
